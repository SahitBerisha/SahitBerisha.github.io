The Blog Web API is a web service that allows users to manage their blog posts. The API was built using Java, Spring Boot, and JPA with Hibernate. The API includes endpoints for creating, retrieving, updating, and deleting blogs, as well as searching for blogs by title. This API was developed as a personal project to improve my skills in building RESTful web services.
