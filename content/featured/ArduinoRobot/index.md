The Arduino Robot Car project was a personal endeavor to explore the capabilities of the Arduino platform and gain experience in embedded systems. The car was designed to move in all directions, with the ability to detect obstacles and avoid collisions using an ultrasonic sensor. An ultrasonic sensor was used to detect obstacles in the car's path and change its course accordingly. The Adafruit Motor Shield and DC motors were used to control the car's movement.
