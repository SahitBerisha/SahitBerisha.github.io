Quiz Web Services is a simple personal project developed to gain experience with the Quarkus framework. This RESTful API allows players to create, and take quizzes with features such as multiple-choice questions and score tracking. The API was built using Java and the Quarkus framework as an initial step to get started with Quarkus.
